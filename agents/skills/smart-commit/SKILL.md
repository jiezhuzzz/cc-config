Use when the user needs to organize uncommitted changes that mix multiple change types (feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, etc.) into separate semantic commits. Handles partial file staging when a single file contains multiple change types.

# Smart Commit

Intelligently analyze git diffs and split mixed changes into clean, logical conventional commits using the standard format: `type(scope): description`.

## Workflow

Follow this systematic approach to create semantic commits from mixed changes:

### 1. Analyze Current State

First, understand what changes exist:

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# View all unstaged changes
git diff

# View all staged changes (if any)
git diff --staged

# View both staged and unstaged changes
git diff HEAD
```

Determine which changes exist and whether they're staged or unstaged.

### 2. Analyze and Categorize Changes

Examine the diff output and categorize each change by:

**Change Type** - See [references/commit-types.md](references/commit-types.md) for detailed guidance:
- `feat`: New features or functionality
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (deps, config, etc.)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, whitespace, missing semicolons
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `build`: Build system or external dependencies

**Scope** - The area affected (optional but recommended):
- Examples: `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `database`, `config`

**File-level Analysis** - For each file, identify:
- Which lines/hunks belong to which change type
- Whether the file contains a single change type (simple) or multiple types (needs splitting)

### 3. Create Commit Plan

Present a clear commit plan to the user showing:

1. **Commit sequence** - Logical order of commits
2. **For each commit:**
   - Commit message: `type(scope): description`
   - Files affected and what changes will be included
   - For files with mixed changes: specify which lines/hunks will be staged

**Example format:**
```
Proposed commit plan:

Commit 1: feat(auth): add login endpoint
- src/auth.js (lines 10-25: new login function)
- src/routes.js (full file: new route registration)

Commit 2: refactor(auth): rename authentication variables
- src/auth.js (lines 40-55: variable renaming)
- src/config.js (full file: config variable updates)

Commit 3: docs(auth): fix typo in authentication comments
- src/auth.js (line 70: comment fix)

Does this plan look good?
```

**Ordering principle**: Commit in logical order - typically feat → fix → refactor → chore → docs/style. This makes the history easier to understand.

### 4. Get User Approval

Wait for explicit user approval before executing the plan. Users may request adjustments to:
- Commit messages
- Which changes are grouped together
- The order of commits
- Scope definitions

### 5. Execute Commits

Once approved, execute the commits using git's partial staging capabilities:

**For files with single change type:**
```bash
git add path/to/file
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

**For files with mixed changes:**

Use interactive staging to stage only relevant portions:

**Option A: Patch mode (when changes are in separate hunks):**
```bash
# Review each hunk interactively
git add -p path/to/file
# For each hunk:
# - y: stage this hunk
# - n: skip this hunk
# - s: split hunk into smaller hunks
# - e: manually edit the hunk
# - q: quit (don't stage remaining hunks)

git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

**Option B: Manual edit (when changes are interleaved):**
```bash
# Opens diff in editor to manually select lines
git add -e path/to/file
# In the editor:
# - Delete lines you DON'T want to stage (lines starting with +/-)
# - Keep lines you DO want to stage
# - Save and exit

git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

**Important notes:**
- After each commit, verify what's left: `git status` and `git diff`
- Continue with the next commit in the sequence
- If using `git add -p` or `git add -e`, you may need to run them multiple times for the same file across different commits

### 6. Verify Results

After all commits are created:

```bash
# Review commit history
git log --oneline -n <number-of-commits>

# Review each commit's changes
git show HEAD    # most recent commit
git show HEAD~1  # previous commit
git show HEAD~2  # two commits ago
```

Confirm all changes have been committed and the history looks clean.

## Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Multiple files, each with single change type**
- Straightforward: `git add` each file and commit

**Scenario 2: One file with multiple change types in separate areas**
- Use `git add -p` to stage hunks individually

**Scenario 3: One file with interleaved changes**
- Use `git add -e` for precise line-by-line control

**Scenario 4: Mix of simple and complex files**
- Handle simple files first with full `git add`
- Use partial staging for complex files

## Guidelines

- **Be thorough**: Analyze every line to ensure proper categorization
- **Communicate clearly**: Show the user exactly what will be committed in each step
- **Stay atomic**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Follow conventions**: Use standard conventional commit format consistently
- **Verify continuously**: Check status and diff after each commit to track progress
- **Handle errors gracefully**: If staging fails, explain what happened and adjust approach
